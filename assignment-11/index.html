      Choosing a pet is a decision to not take lightly. Whether it's a dog, cat or gerbil, you are choosing to care for another being and that is a commitment for the remainder of their life.
      It's important to choose the right pet for you to create the best possible connection and life for you both.
      To help make this decision, here are a few questions you can ask yourself:

      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <li> What species is my favorite type of pet?
      <li> How much time can I commit to a pet?
      <li> How active a pet would I like?
      <li> Can I afford the care my desired pet will require?
      <li> What temperament would I like in my pet?
      <li> Would I prefer a young or older pet?
      <li> Who will care for a pet in my family?
      <li> Do I have the necessary space for a pet?
      <li> Can I provide the proper exercise for a pet?
      <li> What is my ultimate desire in getting a pet?
