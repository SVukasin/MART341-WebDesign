### Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.
Browsers are software programs used to access the internet. They are basically translators that take internet/web languages and translate them into the intended  layout including graphics and other content that can be digested by humans.

Currently, I use Google Chrome for both work and surfing. For some troubleshooting, I often use Safari or Microsoft Edge. I don't particularly like using Safari on my iPhone, so I have my default browser set to Google Chrome on my phone as well.
