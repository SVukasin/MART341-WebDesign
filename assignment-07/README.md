### Please describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

- Every day I use the text form input form piece to login to my accounts for work and leisure. Today, while browsing for cars, I used dropdown menus, fill-in forms, checkboxes and more. All of these forms gathered information either about me or about the car I was looking for.
