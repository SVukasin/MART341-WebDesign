###How did your user testing sessions go?
- good! There was some really good feedback and some really constructive criticism.

### What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
- So far I've changed the text color and have been working on updating the buttons but haven't figured that out yet. I also need to spend some more time on the events & contact us pages. I want to use the feedback and make further changes, I just haven't yet. I also had some feedback about the navigation bar, but haven't been able to figure that out yet. So working on that. 

#Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
- I wanted to integrate some cool calendar features for events, but that was a bit out of my realm, so scratched that for now. I also, for whatever reason, cannot ever get the relative links to stick, so got some feedback and have been adding them hoping repetition works. I wanted to add a gif to the About Us hero image, but the file was too large and I couldn't compress it, so I had to replace it with an image.
