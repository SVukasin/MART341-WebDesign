### Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

- I've taught myself some bare basics HTML. The biggest thing I learned was adjusting the pages displays and really learning and understanding divs. I had a general understanding of headings, links, etc. but was also happy to learn more about head, body, and other distinctions.

### After we come back from spring break we will start to dive into CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

- I was anxious about creating a nav bar and ensuring the links all connected and remained the same across every page. That was easier than anticipated. I'm also anxious to learn about how to design a page that looks more like my wireframe with three images in a row rather than stacked. Banner blocks/images and banners that rotate images. I'm excited to learn how to put together bio blocks with an image and text to horizontally like in my wireframe.
