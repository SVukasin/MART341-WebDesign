### Describe the difference between semantic and structural markup.
- Semantic markup is used to place an emphasis on a word or phrase - it's used to reinforce the meaning of the words or phrases it is used on - bold, italics, underline, etc. Whereas Structural Markup, as inferred by the name, is used to adjust the structure of the document - headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.
