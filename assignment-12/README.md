### What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
-

Border: A border simply defines the outline around a particular element. If I think of it like a cake or frosting layers, it could be considered Layer 1. Unlike the other two mentioned, the border is the only one that can have it's color changed and styled.
Padding: space between inner content and the element itself. Layer 2
Margin: the next layer outside the padding and is between the element and other elements (blocks, sections, etc.) Layer 3
