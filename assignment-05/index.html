              Big Lies In A Small Town is a riveting story about Morgan Christopher who took the fall for a crime she did not commit protecting someone she loved.
              She is forced to put her career on hold while she pays the price for the crime. However, she is given the opportunity to live in a small town and restore
              an old mural created in 1940 by a woman named Anna Dale. If the mural is completed on time, she is released early.

              While this all seems pretty easy, while working on this restoration piece, Morgan discovers a deep story about madness, violence, and conspiracy of this small town's secrets.
