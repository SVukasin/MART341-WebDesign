### Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine.

- Facebook.com

### What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?

- 2005
- It is completely different than it looks now. Since I can't log in to see the registered user interface, I can't speak to that, but I do know that the login page looks entirely different.
The intro and tagline is completely different.  The font was the same, or at least appears that way to me, but the name was also thefacebook instead of Facebook. The design was a lot more text heavy than it is now. Now it is way more simple and has more white space. 
I compared to 2008 (when I originally created an account) and that was closer to the version we see now, but still very different and a throwback for sure!
