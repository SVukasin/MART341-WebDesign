###What is the goal of your website? (Think in terms of your user -- why might they visit your site?)
- Consulting. I want users to be able to navigate to the site, read/view why I'm qualified to be their consultant, why they would hire me, what they would hire me for. I want to answer questions with an FAQ and provide a contact me page.

### Why is responsive web design important?
- Since many people view websites on both their phone and mobile device (but primarily mobile) it is important your website appears the same or very similar on both.
